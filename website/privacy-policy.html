                    In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data
                    protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your
                    personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of
                    your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances,
                    you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make
                    such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU
                    CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” below.
                    <br><br>
                    We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
                    information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
                    authority. You can find their contact details here:
                    https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are
                    available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.

                    Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
                    which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
                    withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
                    using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
                    <br><br>
                    However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
                    withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
                    information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

                <p class="sectionContent">
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                    choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
